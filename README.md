Implemented arith_id(), mult_id(), and mult_by_zero().

I will definitely be using testing frameworks in the future. It's nice to be able to set it up and let it do the work checking for you. Walking the tree and using join is something else that I believe I will use in the future. 

One thing that I found difficult at the beginning was setting up the reading of files and walking the tree. I understand it much better now. What difficulty I am facing right now is that mult_by_zero() somehow is getting a bool value in it, and is throwing everything off. Where does it get that bool? It's driving me nuts. Update, I got the mult_by_zero() working.
